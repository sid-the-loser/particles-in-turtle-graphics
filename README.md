# Particles in Turtle Graphics

This code is actually a turtle port of a pygame code written by DaFluffyPotato (links to his YT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNrBrBOgTfHswcz2DdZQFA). So all credit goes to him. I hope that you will be able to understand the code even without the comments, but you can read them to understand things if you get stuck.
